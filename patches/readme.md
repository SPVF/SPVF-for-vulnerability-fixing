#  line3: expected output
#
#  <unk> is produced because of OOV(out of vocabulary)
#  <unk-i> can be recovered according to the position in the input
#  code, that is, the same word in that position in the input code. 
#
#  We are woking on a new version that better recovers the <unk>

### Example
```
number-> 46
output genereated by SPVF--> long long <unk-2> ( const <unk-5> * pChapters ) const  
expected output--> long long <unk-2> ( const <unk-5> * pChapters ) const

According to the dataset,
cweid --> CWE-119,
functionbefore-> "long long Chapters::Atom::GetStartTime ( const Chapters * pChapters ) const { return GetTime ( pChapters , m _ start _ timecode ) ; }",
functionafter--> "long long Chapters::Atom::GetStartTime ( const Chapters * pChapters ) const" 

And that <unk-2> represents Chapters::Atom::GetStartTime
<unk-5> Chapters *

In this example, SPVF successfully fixes by deleting " { return GetTime ( pChapters , m _ start _ timecode ) ; } "

```
